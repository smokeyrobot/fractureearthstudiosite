  missionstatement = "First, we want to drop a little bit of American music history. In the late 70's/early 80's, a feirce musical movement with a punk rock emphasis was initiated whose influence can still be seen in today's music and culture. The bands of this movement were passionate and driven in their craft because their goal was simple. They had a message and desired a platform to reach as many people as possible with that message. The core method for accomplishing their mission came in the form of DIY, or Do It Yourself. When these early contributors first sought to record and perform their music, they were't the most technical players and they didn't have access to high end instruments or recording equipment, but they played with a sharp drive and focused passion for what they were doing. The resulting raw and unfiltered sounds that these young artists produced developed into one of music's most influential generes of the 20th century. Though the music they produced was unpolished and a little rough around the edges, there was energy and character in their performances and recordings. Before Fractured Earth started, studio creator, Mark Shepherd knew he wanted to make games that he thought were and convey entertaining narratives and ideas through these games. The problem was that Mark had no idea how to make a game. Taking a note from the 80's DC Hardcore scene, he just decided to do it. After asking a close friend, Rob Lee to help out with art and countless hours of reading materials on coding, game engines and watching more than 100 video tutorials, Mark is a self taught programer and is hungry to get his ideas to fellow gamers everywhere! The projects developed by Fractured Earth Studio may not be the most polished experiences, but it is the goal of this studio to always produce games that are engaging, unique, interesting, and just plain fun to play! We truly belive our style really shines in it's DIY presentation and nature. We will always put our heart and souls into our games and we think players we feel the passion and enjoy our games just as much as we enjoy making them."
